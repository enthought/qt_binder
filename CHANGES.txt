QtBinder CHANGELOG
==================

Release 0.4
-----------

This release adds support for PySide6/Qt6. Qt6 dropped some signal overloads,
which require some changes to the wrapping strategy. Now, the first overload is
given the plain unqualified name of the signal, without the extra type
information. This usually corresponds to the signal that remains in Qt6. For
example, `QComboBox.currentIndexChanged(int)` is now the sole implementation of
that signal in Qt6, so the trait created for it is now just
`currentIndexChanged` and not `currentIndexChanged_int`.
