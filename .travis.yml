branches:
  # We have both "Build pushes" and "Build PRs" turned on. Without the
  # following setting, Travis CI will do 2 builds for every update to a PR, one
  # which is tested as merged into master (what we want) and one just as the
  # raw PR branch (meh). We'd also like to run an additional test for any
  # pushes to master (which should only be PR merges). The following setting
  # whitelists master as a branch for the "push" builds. PR builds will happen
  # regardless. If you want your WIP branches tested, open up a WIP PR.
